   .SYNOPSIS
   Uninstalls the old and retired Anti-spam Agents from an Exchange Server

   .DESCRIPTION
   Microsoft announced that they deprecated the support for the SmartScreen Anti-spam content filters for Exchange Servers. This script uninstalls the old an retired SmartScreen Anti-spam Agents from the local Exchange Server.
   This is an easy to use and light weight replacement for Uninstall-AntiSpamAgents.ps1 from the \Scripts of your Exchange Installation, it will remove just the dead parts and leave the rest as it is. Some find that it might be better to leave the rest intact.

   .EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> Remove-AntiSpamAgents

   .NOTES
   Find a suitable an solid replacement solution for your email hygiene. This could be any 3rd party solution on premise or cloud. Never use email without any good email hygiene!

   If you want, you might run the Uninstall-AntiSpamAgents.ps1 from the \Scripts folder created by Setup during Exchange installation. It removes everything related to the AntiSpamAgents.
