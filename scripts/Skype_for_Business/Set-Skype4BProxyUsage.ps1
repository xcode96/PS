   .SYNOPSIS
   Skype for Business should use Proxy Server

   .DESCRIPTION
   Skype for Business should use Proxy Server to sign in instead of trying a direct connection.
   Works with Skype for Business 2015 and 2016 and should work with Lync 1013 as well.

   .EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> .\Set-Skype4BProxyUsage.ps1

   .NOTES
   Please note: This is a per user setting!

   SIP is not used between Clients (aka P2P or Cleint to Client).
   It wil be used between Client and Server and/or Server and Server.
   Media Bypass will be used for RTP media between Clients (when possible)
