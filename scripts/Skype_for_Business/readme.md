# Legacy Notice

I no longer run Exchange, Skype for Business, or any other Office Server on Premises.
This is my personal [reaction](https://hochwald.net/microsoft-rolls-back-decision-to-take-away-internal-usage-rights-from-partners/) to the changes that Microsoft [announced](https://hochwald.net/microsoft-is-going-to-kill-internal-use-rights-benefit-for-partners/) for the Internal Use Rights (IUR) program. I know that they decided to reverse that changes and in theory, I could still legally use the software. However, I decided to decommission everything licensed under the terms of the Internal Use Rights (IUR) program.
In my opinion, the community always should have some benefits from the Internal Use Rights (IUR) program and/or Action Pack. Now that I decided to drop out, there will be no more such benefits.

I will _no longer maintain_ the scripts related to the Microsoft Office (on Premises) servers. They will remain here, but unmaintained. Fork the repository and maintain or extend them if you like to. The [License](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/blob/master/LICENSE) allows that easily.
