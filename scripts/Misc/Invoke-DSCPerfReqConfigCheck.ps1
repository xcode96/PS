      .NOTES
      I do a lot of testing with several DSC configurations.
      I just want a TRUE or FALSE as return to see if its working, or not.
      You may guess why: I use this in a CI chain :-)

      You may want to have separated EventLog entries for DSC (useful for the log-Resource):
      & "$env:windir\system32\wevtutil.exe" set-log 'Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Analytic' /q:true /e:true
      & "$env:windir\system32\wevtutil.exe" set-log 'Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Debug' /q:True /e:true
