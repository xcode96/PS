   .SYNOPSIS
   Quick an dirty Windows Service Monitor

   .DESCRIPTION
   I came across the the problem, that one of the services I depend one was not started after the system reboots.
   That happens after a .NET update. So I decided to create this real simple monitor to make sure, that this service is running.
   If not, the script tries to restart it.

   .PARAMETER MonService
   The Service we would like to check. Default is RoyalServer

   .EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> .\Check-ServiceMonitor.ps1

   .EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> .\Check-ServiceMonitor.ps1 -MonService 'myservice'

   .NOTES
   The script itself have some basic error handling,
   nothing to complex or fancy.
