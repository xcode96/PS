   .SYNOPSIS
   PowerShell Module maintenance

   .DESCRIPTION
   Quick and dirty script that removes all older versions of all installed PowerShell Modules.

   .EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> .\invoke-ModuleMaint.ps1

   # Removes all old versions for all installed PowerShell Modules.

   .NOTES
   Why:
   I do an automated update of my Modules, this process just updates straight to the latest and
   greatest version of each installed module. I ended up with a bunch of older version for most
   Modules, and I needed something to clean this up.

   I found several stuff that does the same thing, but they all use "Get-InstalledModule" and the
   performance of this command is terrible! I have to use "Uninstall-Module" that is slow enough,
   so I needed something that runs faster on my system, where I have a lot of Modules installed.

   Please note:
   This will try to remove all older versions of all installed powerShell versions.
   There might be issues with newer versions, so be aware of that.
   There is no check, just a simple removal off all older versions.
