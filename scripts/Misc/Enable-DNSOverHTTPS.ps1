	.SYNOPSIS
	Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) if device is not domain-joined

	.DESCRIPTION
	Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) if device is not domain-joined

	It enables the Cloudflare DNS Servers, even if DoH is not working yet.

	IPv6 Support is optional.

	.PARAMETER IPv6
	Enable IPv6 Support, IPv6 Servers will be added to the serverlist

	.EXAMPLE
	PS C:\> .\Enable-DNSOverHTTPS.ps1

	Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) if device is not domain-joined for IPv4 only

	.EXAMPLE
	PS C:\> .\Enable-DNSOverHTTPS.ps1 -IPv6

	Enable DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) if device is not domain-joined for IPv4 and IPv6

	.NOTES
	Only the Insider Build of Windows 10 supports DoH!
	But we configure it anyway!

	The Cloudflare servers are used for regular DNS resolution and as soon as DoH is supported,
	we can configure and use it anyway.

	A future version of this script might support additional parameters, like DohFlags

	You can also change the servers below to any service you like, e.g. Google DNS or Quad9 from IBM.

	The Bool as return was requested by a customer, and the exit code (0 or 1) is implemented for our bootstrap setup
