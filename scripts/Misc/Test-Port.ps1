function Test-Port
{
   <#
      .SYNOPSIS
      Tests port on a given computer.

      .DESCRIPTION
      Tests port on computer. This functions supports both: TCP and UPD

      .PARAMETER computer
      Name of server to test the port connection on.

      .PARAMETER port
      Port to test

      .PARAMETER tcp
      Use tcp port

      .PARAMETER udp
      Use udp port

      .PARAMETER UDPTimeOut
      Sets a timeout for UDP port query. (In milliseconds, Default is 1000)

      .PARAMETER TCPTimeOut
      Sets a timeout for TCP port query. (In milliseconds, Default is 1000)

      .EXAMPLE
      Test-Port -computer 'server' -port 80
      Checks port 80 on server 'server' to see if it is listening

      .EXAMPLE
      'server' | Test-Port -port 80
      Checks port 80 on server 'server' to see if it is listening

      .EXAMPLE
      Test-Port -computer @("server1","server2") -port 80
      Checks port 80 on server1 and server2 to see if it is listening

      .EXAMPLE
      Test-Port -computer dc1 -port 17 -udp -UDPtimeout 10000

      Server   : dc1
      Port     : 17
      TypePort : UDP
      Open     : True
      Notes    : "My spelling is Wobbly.  It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters
      get in the wrong places." A. A. Milne (1882-1958)

      Description
      -----------
      Queries port 17 (qotd) on the UDP port and returns whether port is open or not

      .EXAMPLE
      @("server1","server2") | Test-Port -port 80
      Checks port 80 on server1 and server2 to see if it is listening

      .EXAMPLE
      (Get-Content hosts.txt) | Test-Port -port 80
      Checks port 80 on servers in host file to see if it is listening

      .EXAMPLE
      Test-Port -computer (Get-Content hosts.txt) -port 80
      Checks port 80 on servers in host file to see if it is listening

      .EXAMPLE
      Test-Port -computer (Get-Content hosts.txt) -port @(1..59)
      Checks a range of ports from 1-59 on all servers in the hosts.txt file

      .NOTES
      For TCP tests, you might want to use Test-NetConnection
      But Test-NetConnection is unable to test UDP Ports
